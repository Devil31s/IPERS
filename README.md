```diff
- Please pay attention to the version of SC2 you are using for your experiments. 
- Performance is *not* always comparable between versions. 
- The results in SMAC (https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04043) use SC2.4.6.2.69232 not SC2.4.10.
```

## Installation instructions

Build the Dockerfile using 
```shell
cd docker
bash build.sh
```

Set up StarCraft II and SMAC:
```shell
bash install_sc2.sh
```

This will download SC2 into the 3rdparty folder and copy the maps necessary to run over.

The requirements.txt file can be used to install the necessary packages into a virtual environment (not recomended).

## Run an experiment 

```shell
python3 src/main.py --config=qmix --env-config=sc2 with env_args.map_name=2s3z t_max=3005000
```
